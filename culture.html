        <h1>Pakistani Culture</h1>

        <div class="culture-section">
            <h2>Family Structure</h2>
            <p>Throughout Pakistan, as in most agrarian societies, family organization is strongly patriarchal, and most people live with large extended families, often in the same house or family compound. The eldest male, whether he is the father, grandfather, or paternal uncle, is the family leader and makes all significant decisions regarding the family and its members.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="culture-section">
            <h2>Role of Women</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, a woman's place in society has been secondary to that of men, and she has been restricted to the performance of domestic chores and to fulfilling the role of a dutiful wife and mother. However, in the Punjab, cotton picking is exclusively a woman's job, and women may keep the money thus earned for their own purposes.</p>
            
            <p>In wealthy peasant and landowner households and in urban middle-class families, the practice of keeping women in seclusion (purdah) is still common; when women leave their houses, they typically cover their heads. Among the rural poor, women have duties on the farm as well as in the house and do not customarily observe purdah.</p>
            
            <p>Houses of those who practice purdah have a men's section (mardānah) at the front of the house, so that visitors do not disturb the women, who are secluded in the women's section (zanānah) in the rear.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="culture-section">
            <h2>Changing Roles</h2>
            <p>Among the wealthiest Pakistanis, Western education and modes of living have eliminated purdah, but, in general, even among that group, attitudes toward women in society and the family often have been viewed by outsiders as antiquated.</p>
            
            <p>Change has occurred most rapidly among the urban middle-income group, inspired by increasing access to the West as well as by the entry of women into the workforce and into government service. An increasing number of middle-class women have stopped observing purdah, and the education of women has been encouraged.</p>
            
            <p>Some women have gained distinction in the professions; some of Pakistan's leading politicians, journalists, and teachers have been women, and a woman has served as prime minister and as speaker of parliament.</p>
